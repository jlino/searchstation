# SearchStation
This is a simple java application developed for the purpose of demonstrating a search algorithm to help a user entering the name of a station in train ticket machine.<br>
The <b>search algorithm can be found [at this location](src/main/java/com/joaolino/searchstation/Model/StationModel.java)</b>, as well as the example data used by it.<br>
<br>
The algorithm searches for for stations that start with a given string and outputs:<br>
<b>a.</b>	All stations names that start with the search string;<br>
<b>b.</b>	All valid next characters for each matched station;<br>
<br>
As this should be capable of being easily integrated in a touch based user interface, the application was built using the MVC design patterns to separete logic.<br>
